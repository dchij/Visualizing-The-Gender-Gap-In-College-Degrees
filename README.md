# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees

In this project I will be working on visualizing the data from The Department of Education Statistics.

The department releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category. The dataset for this project, compiled by Randal Olsan, a data scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.

The Aim of this project is to compare the gender gap in all degree categories using data visualization.
